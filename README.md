# JS-DoodlePad

Developed a recorder application that relies on a Javascript singly-linked list. The application allows the user to draw on a canvas and record their strokes to be saved(local memory) and replayed.

To run the code: 
  1. simply download the repository
  2. run the command npx serve in terminal within the directory
  3. select the recorder.html file.
